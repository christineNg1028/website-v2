          Wealthsimpleâ€™s top priority for 2022 was to build a better spend,
          send, and save experience than the big banks, to become the primary
          financial relationship for the future majority. I returned to
          Wealthsimple as a software and PM intern on the Cash Chequing Account
          Team, where I had the unique experience of bringing banking features
          to life from product vision to implementation.

          This term was very challenging, as it was my first time doing backend,
          coding in Ruby, and working with every tool which was used. I felt the
          impact of my work, as my team was doing the most important work in the
          company and I had a lot of ownership over groundwork development.

            We had the functionality to send e-Transfers through Cash to
            non-Cash clients, but were now building the functionality for
            transactions in the opposite direction. The e-Transfer Funding
            project was phase 1 of e-Transfers into Cash, phase 2 was P2P
            receiving. We were enabling clients to:

            For the technical evaluation, I created the connection between our
            internal banking service and our vendor handling the movement of
            money. I wrote code to receive and handle their REST-based webhook
            calls by going through an intermediary that assessed basic auth and
            proxied to our service.

            For the playtest, I defined patterns for the business logic that
            initiates e-Transfer funding and processes the transaction with our
            provider. This stage of development required close collaboration
            with the Money Movement team in the making of technical design /
            architectural decisions. We also collaborated with the Cash P2P
            team, as the e-Transfer funding project made up the foundation
            (~75%) of the work they had to do for e-Transfer receiving.

            The existing e-Transfer send feature experienced an incident where
            transactions were failing on our end but not on our vendorâ€™s end.
            This affected ~215 transactions and caused clients to retry sending
            multiple times or withdraw the funds. The incident was due to
            problems on both sides, but mainly the retry policy and a lack of
            resilience in our banking service.

            Bill pay was my first project and I worked as an associate product
            DRI. I learned what itâ€™s like to start a project from scratch and
            use PM frameworks to guide our product decisions.

            I worked with the Cash UXR team to conduct client interviews, which
            helped us identify user pain points with current bill pay solutions
            and the most important functionalities to clients. We also ideated
            ways we could add delight to make the bill pay experience better
            than the banks. I created a project brief outlining the problem and
            how weâ€™re gonna solve it, making it super clear to design and
            engineering. This allowed us to define the north star experience,
            align on phasing, and begin preliminary designs.
