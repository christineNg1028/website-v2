          Frec is an investment platform that offers direct indexing, allowing
          individuals to own the underlying stocks of an index. This approach
          enables tax-loss harvesting and portfolio customization while aiming
          to track index performance. The platform uses algorithmic portfolio
          management, with a minimum investment of $20,000 and fees starting at
          0.09%.

          I became a Freckle for my sixth and final internship as a Waterloo
          student. I was excited to join a tiny startup in SF, where I got to
          wear many hats and have a real say in the product direction. I focused
          primarily on frontend, but also dabbled in design and took on some
          scrum master duties like leading standups and retros. If there was
          something I was interested in, I could dive into it ‚Äî and I did.

            Index Explorer was a major feature project aimed at reworking how
            users search for and set up their investments. Previously, users
            would enter the direct indexing flow through the home screen, then
            select from a list of indices. Separately, there was the Trade flow,
            where users could search for and trade individual stocks.

            This was a meaty project with a lot of moving parts and a tight
            deadline. I led the project end-to-end ‚Äî breaking down product
            requirements into manageable chunks, setting a timeline, and
            collaborating cross-functionally with engineering, design, product,
            and marketing to keep everything on track.

            It was the first big feature I led with this level of ownership, and
            it ended up being a huge learning experience. Working solo for most
            of it was tough, but it taught me when to pull in others, how to
            advocate for urgency (especially in a startup where attention is
            split), and how to balance product priorities with technical
            constraints. I also learned to speak up when alternative solutions
            could simplify the implementation without compromising quality ‚Äî
            whether that meant suggesting design tweaks or negotiating scope
            with product and marketing.

            One of my personal goals was to launch the feature with ‚Äúno bugs‚Äù ‚Äî
            obviously, that‚Äôs nearly impossible, but I meant no major
            functionality issues. And we did it! The feature shipped with only a
            couple of minor bugs. To make that happen, I led multiple rounds of
            testing ‚Äî design reviews, company-wide bug squashes, and engineering
            bug fests. We kept a big shared spreadsheet to track bugs and assign
            fixes, and that process worked really well for quality control.
