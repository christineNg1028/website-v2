          The 2021 AI for Future Business Challenge was hosted by Technation, in
          partnership with RBC and Microsoft. The competition challenged teams
          to propose a new AI technology that would solve a critical problem
          within a traditional sector. I teamed up with a few of my co-workers
          from Dataraction, and together, we came{" "}

        <div>
          Small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) contribute to 90% of the
          Canadian economy but many are experiencing disruptions and struggling
          due to COVID-19. These businesses cannot afford mainstream ERP
          software, and thus, they don‚Äôt have access to resources to find
          business opportunities and relevant market insights.

        <div>The Solution:</div>
        <div>
          DotsLogistics was born to fulfill the needs of SMEs. It is a web
          platform supporting B2B and B2C relationships through a free
          marketplace and AI analytics to provide trustworthy partners and
          superior real-time insights.

          DotsLogistics aims to support SMEs where mainstream platforms do not,
          providing dependable supply chain resources to improve efficiency and
          reduce costs. The platform boasts a simple, modern, and intuitive
          interface, so that all business owners, regardless of size, budget,

          During the development stage, I built the marketplace - the heart of
          DotsLogistics. The marketplace is where businesses can find partners
          such as carriers and shippers tailored to their needs. An AI
          recommendation engine matches shippers' business profile to business
          partners according to their criteria and previous transactions.
