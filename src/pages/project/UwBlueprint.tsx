          <div>
            When I joined the HeadsUpGuys team, I knew that I wanted to grow my
            skills in backend. Being a new Blueprint project, it was a bit of a
            unique experience as I was involved in the building of the backend
            from the ground up. I helped with planning and implementation of the
            initial database schema, focusing on the self-assessment models.
            There was a lot of decision-making and back-and-forth between team
            members, so it was really interesting to learn from each other.
          </div>
          <div>
            We then worked together to plan out the REST API routes that would
            interact with the database, using charts like the one above for each
            model. I wrote functions for creating, updating, getting, and
            deleting self-assessments.

          The primary focus of the project during the first 8 months was to
          build the majority of the admin-facing features, the Module Builder
          being the largest component. The Module Builder is a no-code tool that
          allows admins to create learning modules for users, consisting of
          various interactive and static components. These modules are bundled
          with self-assessments within Tools that are tailored to the user. My
          role was to build out many of the UI components, as well as hook up
          the frontend to the backend.

            The admin Tools dashboard is where admins can view their drafted and
            published tools, as well as create, edit, and delete them. I created
            this tool card that varies depending on whether the tool is drafted
            or published, and whether it has a module linked to it. Clicking on
            the card takes you to the tool builder page for that tool.

          <div>
            The Toolkit landing page is what users see upon logging in to the
            app. The Toolkit houses all of their Tools, divided into Life
            Problems (ex. Anxiety, Depression) and Skills (ex. Creating a
            balanced life). Here, users can view all of the Tools they have
            progress on, and quickly access a module or take a self-check quiz.
            I was in charge of building this page and the components within it.

          <div>
            Initially, when we began hooking up the frontend to the backend,
            data fetching was being done using useEffect and React state. This
            had a number of issues, including inconsistent fetching and
            confusing UX as there was no loading placeholder. My task was to
            migrate from useEffect to useSWR to include loading placeholders
            (see green spinner and loading modal in videos above). I then
            refactored the Modules and Tools page to consist of static
            components (header) and dynamic components (containing all data).
