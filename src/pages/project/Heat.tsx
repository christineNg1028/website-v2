          HEAT was my final-year interdisciplinary capstone project at the
          University of Waterloo.

          Densely populated Canadian cities are increasingly facing the urban
          heat island (UHI) effect, where infrastructure absorbs and retains
          heat, making cities significantly hotter than surrounding areas. This
          poses growing risks to public health, energy use, and urban
          livability, especially for vulnerable communities. Most existing
          solutions rely on satellite imagery, which lacks the spatial and
          temporal resolution to reveal how heat fluctuates throughout the day
          or whatâ€™s causing it at the street level.
        </div>
        <div>
          To address these gaps, we developed HEAT, a scalable, solar-powered
          sensor network that collects real-feel temperature data (humidity,
          wind, solar irradiance, and tree canopy coverage), to calculate Wet
          Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT), a more accurate indicator of heat
          stress. Designed to be mounted on bikes, transit, or stationary posts,
          HEAT enables localized, high-resolution data collection across diverse
          urban environments. The data is visualized through ArcGIS heat maps,
          helping decision-makers identify hot zones, track changes over time,
          and inform targeted interventions like tree planting or reflective
          surface upgrades. By offering a cost-effective and mobile solution,
          HEAT empowers cities to build more climate-resilient communities. ðŸ”¥

          As part of the interdisciplinary team behind HEAT, I wore many
          hatsâ€”contributing across product strategy, hardware development, and
          user storytelling. I was deeply involved from the project's earliest
          phases and played a key role in shaping both the vision and execution.
